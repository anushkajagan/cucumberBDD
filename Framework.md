Overview
This repository is a TypeScript + Cucumber (BDD) test automation framework. It uses Gherkin feature files under features/, TypeScript step definitions under step_definitions/, and helper utilities under utils/. Test orchestration, hooks, and world-level state live in hooks/. Reports, logs and artifacts are in reports/ and logs/. Configuration and credentials are in config/.

Quick install & run (recommended)

Install dependencies from package.json:
If you need to add Cucumber/TS support manually (only if not already in package.json):
Run Cucumber via npx (example; adapt to scripts in package.json or cucumber.js):
Generate HTML report (if utils/report-generator.js supports it):
